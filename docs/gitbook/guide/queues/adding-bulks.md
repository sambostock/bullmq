# Adding jobs in bulk

Sometimes it is necessary to add many jobs atomically. For example, there could be a requirement that all the jobs must be placed in the queue or none of them. Also, adding jobs in bulk can be faster since it reduces the number of roundtrips to Redis:

```typescript
import { Queue } from 'bullmq';

const queue = new Queue('paint');

const jobs = await queue.addBulk([
  { name, data: { paint: 'car' } },
  { name, data: { paint: 'house' } },
  { name, data: { paint: 'boat' } },
]);
```

This call can only succeed or fail, and all or none of the jobs will be added.
